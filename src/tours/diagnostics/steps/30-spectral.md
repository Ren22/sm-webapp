Here you can see the theoretical isotope pattern and the observed total intensities.
You can zoom in and out using mouse.

It is common to see somewhat lower observed intensities due to pixels where peaks fall below the detection limit being filled with a value of zero whilst sample intensities higher than expected often indicate overlap with another ion.
